## Quick start

- Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/
- Clone this repo.
- From inside the cloned repo run `npm install`.
- You can run the tests with `npm test`.
- Alternatively, use `node .`.

## Troubleshooting

This should run on Linux out of the box. On Windows, it might need some thinkering, e.g. adding the chromedriver to the system PATH.
